# Project: Facial Keypoint Detection

## starter code

- https://github.com/udacity/CVND_Exercises
- https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints.git

Data extracted from xoutube faces dataset: https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/

paper on keypoint extractiion: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00977.pdf


## Observations

- larger batch size reduces training time
- training curves tend to get smoother
- no obvious impact on loss (for baseline net)

## Discussions on dropout

## Discussions regarding conv size / dropout etc.

- OpenHPI
- Géron: 
- Dropout is weird:
